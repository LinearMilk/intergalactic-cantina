## Download and Installation

To run the game locally:

- Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/LinearMilk/intergalactic-cantina.git`
- [Fork, Clone, or Download on GitHub](https://github.com/LinearMilk/intergalactic-cantina)

### Installation

After downloading run `npm install` from the project folder to download and install dependencies.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from the project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into the project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them.
